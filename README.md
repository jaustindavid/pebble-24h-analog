======

An analog watchface based on the "simple analog" example.  Which doesn't actually render correctly, whatever.

This shows a dial with ticks at half-hour intervals, midnight at top, noon at bottom.  Single hand points to the "hour" location, and the month/day are displayed in the face.

This only updates every minute, so I expect to be even lower-power-consumption than usual.
